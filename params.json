{"name":"Baecoin","tagline":"An Open-Source Cryptocurrency for Couples","body":"### Welcome to Baecoin\r\n\r\n![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/1Nhg3Ui.png)\r\n\r\nBaecoin is a lite version of Bitcoin using scrypt as a proof-of-work algorithm.\r\n - 2.5 minute block targets\r\n - subsidy halves in 840k blocks (~4 years)\r\n - ~84 million total coins\r\n\r\nThe rest is the same as Bitcoin.\r\n - 50 coins per block\r\n - 2016 blocks to retarget difficulty\r\n\r\n### Inspiration\r\nBaecoin was inspired by Hajin Park and created by Raul E. Jordan as a powerful new cryptocurrency in the market using the best hashing algorithms. It will always be up and running, no matter what the authorities do.\r\n\r\n### Development process\r\n\r\nDevelopers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think\r\ntheir feature or bug fix is ready.\r\n\r\nIf it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Baecoin\r\ndevelopment team members simply pulls it.\r\n\r\nIf it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch\r\nsubmitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the\r\n[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development).\r\n\r\nThe patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.\r\nDevelopers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't\r\nmatch the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are\r\ncontroversial.\r\n\r\nThe `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be\r\ncompletely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\r\nregularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Baecoin.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Automated Testing\r\n\r\nDevelopers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to\r\nsubmit new unit tests for old code.\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:\r\n\r\n    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test\r\n\r\nUnit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:\r\n\r\n    qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro\r\n    make -f Makefile.test\r\n    ./baecoin-qt_test\r\n\r\n### License\r\nBaecoin is released under the terms of the MIT license.
